# Data-Analyst-Portfolio
**About**

Hi, I'm Anna. I'm currently studying to become a Data Analyst and exploring key tools such as Python, R, Tableau, and SQL.

I have a background in geology and several years of experience in the petroleum industry. Geology is also a form of data analytics â€” geologists interpret indirect measurements to understand reservoir behavior and make production forecasts.

Here, I share some of my learning projects and insights along the way.
