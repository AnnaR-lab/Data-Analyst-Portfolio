# Data-Analyst-Portfolio
## About

Hi, I'm Anna. I'm currently studying to become a Data Analyst and exploring key tools such as Python, R, Tableau, and SQL.

I have a background in geology and several years of experience in the petroleum industry. Geology is also a form of data analytics — geologists interpret indirect measurements to understand reservoir behavior and make production forecasts.

Here, I share some of my learning projects and insights along the way.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I share my data analysis projects.

### Practicing EDA of Chips Sales in Cyprus Peripteros using R
This is a self-study project as part of my learning path in data analytics. The dataset is a simplified and anonymized version of retail sales from a peripteros, focused only on chips as a product category. The data was synthetic and does not contain sensitive or real company information
#### **Code 🔗:** [Clean Data](1 Clean Data.R),  [EDA] (2 EDA.R)

#### **Goal:** 
To analyse sales data for chips from a small convenience stores (periptero) in Cyprus. The aim is to identify key customer segments, trends over time, and popular products.

This project consists of two main steps:

1️⃣ Data Cleaning: cleaning transaction dates; merging transaction data with customer information

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): grouping sales by product, months, day of the week; visualizing daily, weekly, and monthly sales; segmenting customers and identifying their product preferences

**Result:**
